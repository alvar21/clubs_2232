##FEATURES

##Weaknesses
1. Default users (users with username firstname_lastname) are not able to change their usernames.

3. If an owner quits a club, he may not be a member of the club, but he will still own the club.

Notes:
* i. On creation of a club, the current user will be the owner of the club.
* ii. Some members may not choose to reveal their addresses, so we give them the option to add their address to our databse by editing their information on the member edit page, or to not do so.

##TRIGGERS:
* i. There is a trigger that updates the user table correspondingly to the edited member info.
* ii. A trigger activated whenever a membership entry is added into the database. It will update the club's entry in stats_membersperclub table and update the number of members of the club the member joined.
* iii. A trigger activated whenever a membership entry is deleted the database. It will update the stats of current number of users in the database and update the number of members of the club the member left.
* iv. On club creation, there is a trigger to update the number of clubs categorised by their types.
* v. On club deletion, there is a trigger to update the number of clubs categorised by their types and delete its entry from stats_membersperclub table.
* vi. A trigger to update the total number of users when a user is registered.

##SIGNALS:

* ii. A signal to update the coordinates of the club's location whenever its address is edited.
