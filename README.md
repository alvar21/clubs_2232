##FEATURES
* i. Users are able to create/join/quit a club.
* ii. Once a new club is created, the current user would be the owner.
* iii. Able to list members of a club (at the club's view)
* iv. Able to view a member's membership information (last paid, date joined)
* v. Owners are able to edit their members' membership information (last paid)
* vi. Admins are able to edit/delete a club.
* vii. Various statistics provided.
* viii. Coordinates can be retrieved from address during club registration automatically.
* ix. Able to list the clubs a member joined.
* x. Admins and owners are able to edit members' info.
* xi. Unauthorised page pops out every time tries to do something outside their given powers.

##Weaknesses
1. Default users (users with username firstname_lastname) are not able to change their usernames.
2. Owners are not able to transfer their ownership.
3. If an owner quits a club, he may not be a member of the club, but he will still own the club.

Notes:
* i. On creation of a club, the current user will be the owner of the club.
* ii. Some members may not choose to reveal their addresses, so we give them the option to add their address to our databse by editing their information on the member edit page, or to not do so.

##TRIGGERS:
* i. There is a trigger that updates the user table correspondingly to the edited member info.
* ii. There are two triggers in the database to update the number of members whenever a user joins or quits that club.
* iii. There is a trigger to check if after a club is deleted, the owner of that club still owns other clubs. If yes, do not delete him from the owner group. If no, delete him from the owner group. 
* The owner group determines whether the user has access to the owner drop down bar. 

##SIGNALS:
* i. A signal to create a member entry with the same id to the primary key of the new user created. The first_name, last_name, email corresponds to the new user's.

##GROUPS:
* i. Owners
* ii. Administrators
* iii. End-users
