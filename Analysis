Weaknesses: 
1) Default users (users with username firstname_lastname) are not able to change their usernames.
2) Owners are not able to transfer their ownership.
3) If an owner quits a club, he may not be a member of the club, but he will still own the club.

To do list:
delete clubs
adminstrator view
members list 

Notes:
on creation of a club, the current user will be the owner of the club.
There is a trigger in the database to update the number of members whenever a user joins that club.
