Weaknesses: 
1) Default users (users with username firstname_lastname) are not able to change their usernames.
2) Owners are not able to transfer their ownership.
3) If an owner quits a club, he may not be a member of the club, but he will still own the club.

To do list:
delete clubs for admin
adminstrator view
members list

TRIGGERS:
(i) There is a trigger that updates the user table correspondingly to the edited member info.
(ii) There are two triggers in the database to update the number of members whenever a user joins or quits that club.
(iii) There is a trigger to check if after a club is deleted, the owner of that club still owns other clubs. If yes, do not delete him from the owner group. If no, delete him from the owner group. 
*The owner group determines whether the user has access to the owner drop down bar. 

SIGNALS:
